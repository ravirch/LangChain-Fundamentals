# LangChain Fundamentals

This project explores the LangChain ecosystem, focusing on understanding and implementing key components like data ingestion, data transformation, embeddings, and vector databases.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into the following stages:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Implemented various techniques such as text loaders and PDF loaders to ingest data.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Used splitting techniques like recursive split, character split, and text split to prepare data for downstream tasks.

3. **Embeddings**:
   - Created embeddings using different models, including HuggingFace and OllamaEmbedding.

4. **Vector Store**:
   - Utilized FAISS and Chroma to create and manage vector databases for efficient data retrieval.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
